# 16  Computer Animation  



Animation is derived from the Latin anima and means the act, process, or result of imparting life, interest, spirit, motion, or activity. Motion is a defining property of life and much of the true art of animation is about how to tell a story, show emotion, or even express subtle details of human character through motion. A computer is a secondary tool for achieving these goals—it is a tool which a skillful animator can use to help get the result he wants faster and without concentrating on technicalities in which he is not interested. Animation without computers, which is now often called “traditional” animation, has a long and rich history of its own which is continuously being written by hundreds of people still active in this art. As in any established field, some time-tested rules have been crystallized which give general high-level guidance to how certain things should be done and what should be avoided. These principles of traditional animation apply equally to computer animation, and we will discuss some of them in this chapter. 

The computer, however, is more than just a tool. In addition to making the animator’s main task less tedious, computers also add some truly unique abilities that were simply not available or were extremely difficult to obtain before. Modern modeling tools allow the relatively easy creation of detailed three-dimensional models, rendering algorithms can produce an impressive range of appearances, from fully photorealistic to highly stylized, powerful numerical simulation algorithms can help to produce desired physics-based motion for particularly hard to animate objects, and motion capture systems give the ability to record and use real-life motion. These developments led to an exploding use of computer animation techniques in motion pictures and commercials, automotive design and architecture, medicine and scientific research, among many other areas. Completely new domains and applications have also appeared including fully computer-animated feature films, virtual/augmented reality systems, and, of course, computer games. 

Other chapters of this book cover many of the developments mentioned above (for example, geometric modeling and rendering) more directly. Here, we will provide an overview only of techniques and algorithms directly used to create and manipulate motion. In particular, we will loosely distinguish and briefly describe four main computer animation approaches:

- Keyframing gives the most direct control to the animator who provides necessary data at some moments in time and the computer fills in the rest. 
- Procedural animation involves specially designed, often empirical, mathematical functions and procedures whose output resembles some particular motion. 
- Physics-based techniques solve differential equation of motion. 
- Motion capture uses special equipment or techniques to record real-world motion and then transfers this motion into that of computer models.

We do not touch upon the artistic side of the field at all here. In general, we cannot possibly do more here than just scratch the surface of the fascinating subject of creating motion with a computer. We hope that readers truly interested in the subject will continue their journey well beyond the material of this chapter.
