# 15 Curves

## 15.1 Curves 

Intuitively, think of a curve as something you can draw with a pen. The curve is the set of points that the pen traces over an interval of time. While we usually think of a pen writing on paper (e.g., a curve that is in a 2D space), the pen could move in 3D to generate a space curve, or you could imagine the pen moving in some other kind of space. Mathematically, definitions of curve can be seen in at least two ways: 1. the continuous image of some interval in an n-dimensional space; 2. a continuous map from a one-dimensional space to an n-dimensional space. Both of these definitions start with the idea of an interval range (the time over which the pen traces the curve). However, there is a significant difference: in the first definition, the curve is the set of points the pen traces (the image), while in the second definition, the curve is the mapping between time and that set of points. For this chapter, we use the first definition. A curve is an infinitely large set of points. The points in a curve have the property that any point has two neighbors, except for a small number of points that have one neighbor (these are the endpoints). Some curves have no endpoints, either because they are infinite (like a line) or they are closed (loop around and connect to themselves).
