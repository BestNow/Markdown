This vector notation will make transforming between different forms of the curve easier. Equation (15.8) describes a curve segment by the set of polynomial coefficients for the simple form of the polynomial. We call such a representation the canonical form. We will denote the parameters of the canonical form by a. While it is mathematically simple, the canonical form is not always the most convenient way to specify curves. For example, we might prefer to specify a line segment by the positions of its endpoints. If we want to define p0 to be the beginning of the segment (where the segment is when u = 0) and p1 to be the end of the line segment (where the line segment is at u = 1), we can write
