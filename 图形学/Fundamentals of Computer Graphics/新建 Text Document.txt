Because the “pen” of the curve is thin (infinitesimally), it is difficult to create
filled regions. While space-filling curves are possible (by having them fold over
themselves infinitely many times), we do not consider such mathematical oddities
here. Generally, we think of curves as the outlines of things, not the “insides.”
The problem that we need to address is how to specify a curve—to give a
name or representation to a curve so that we can represent it on a computer. For
some curves, the problem of naming them is easy since they have known shapes:
line segments, circles, elliptical arcs, etc. A general curve that does not have a
“named” shape is sometimes called a free-form curve. Because a free-form curve
can take on just about any shape, they are much harder to specify.
There are three main ways to specify curves mathematically:
1. Implicit curve representations define the set of points on a curve by giving a
procedure that can test to see if a point in on the curve. Usually, an implicit
curve representation is defined by an implicit function of the form
