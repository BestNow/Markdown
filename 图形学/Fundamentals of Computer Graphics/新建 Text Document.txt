cal size, and we have almost no conscious awareness of the corresponding retinal size of objects. This is similar to lightness constancy, discussed earlier, in that our perception is dominated by inferred properties of the world, not the low level features actually sensed by photoreceptors in the retina. Gregory (1997) describes a simple example of size constancy. Hold your two hands out in front of you, one at armâ€™s length and the other at half that distance away from you (Figure 20.41(a)). Your two hands will look almost the same size, even though the retinal sizes differ by a factor of two. The effect is much less strong if the nearer hand partially occludes the more distant hand, particularly if you close one eye (Figure 20.41(b)).
The visual system also exhibits shape constancy, where the perception of geometric structure is close to actual object geometry than might be expected given the
distortions of the retinal image due to perspective (Figure 20.42).
