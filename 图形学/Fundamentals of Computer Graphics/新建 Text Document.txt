Images as Coded Debugging Output
In many cases, the easiest channel by which to get debugging information out of a
graphics program is the output image itself. If you want to know the value of some
variable for part of a computation that runs for every pixel, you can just modify
your program temporarily to copy that value directly to the output image and skip
the rest of the calculations that would normally be done. For instance, if you
suspect a problem with surface normals is causing a problem with shading, you
can copy the normal vectors directly to the image (x goes to red, y goes to green,
z goes to blue), resulting in a color-coded illustration of the vectors actually being
used in your computation. Or, if you suspect a particular value is sometimes out
of its valid range, make your program write bright red pixels where that happens.
Other common tricks include drawing the back sides of surfaces with an obvious
color (when they are not supposed to be visible), coloring the image by the ID
numbers of the objects, or coloring pixels by the amount of work they took to
compute.
