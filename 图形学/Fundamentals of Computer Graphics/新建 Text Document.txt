Frequently Asked Questions • This chapter discussed probability but not statistics. What is the distinction? Probability is the study of how likely an event is. Statistics infers characteristics of large, but finite, populations of random variables. In that sense, statistics could be viewed as a specific type of applied probability. • Is Metropolis sampling the same as the Metropolis Light Transport Algorithm? No. The Metropolis Light Transport (Veach & Guibas, 1997) algorithm uses Metropolis sampling as part of its procedure, but it is specifically for rendering, and it has other steps as well. Notes The classic reference for geometric probability is Geometric Probability (Solomon, 1978). Another method for picking random edges in a square is given in Random–Edge Discrepancy of Supersampling Patterns (Dobkin & Mitchell, 1993). More information on quasi-Monte Carlo methods for graphics can be found in Efficient Multidimensional Sampling (Kollig & Keller, 2002). Three classic and very readable books on Monte Carlo methods are Monte Carlo Methods (Hammersley & Handscomb, 1964), Monte Carlo Methods, Basics (Kalos & Whitlock, 1986), and The Monte Carlo Method (Sobel, Stone, & Messer, 1975).
